# What is a Digital Twin?

A Digital Twin is a virtual replica of a physical object, system, or process. More than just a 3D model, it's a dynamic, continuously updated simulation that mirrors its real-world counterpart. Data from sensors attached to the physical entity is fed into the digital twin, allowing it to accurately reflect the real-time state, behavior, and even environmental conditions of its twin.

In robotics, digital twins are revolutionary. They enable engineers and AI developers to interact with a robot's virtual counterpart as if it were the real thing, but without physical constraints or risks. This virtual representation can encompass a robot's mechanics, sensors, actuators, software, and its operating environment. It serves as a powerful tool for monitoring, analysis, prediction, and optimization throughout the robot's lifecycle, accelerating development and improving operational efficiency.
