# Nav2 Chapter Summary

This chapter introduced Nav2 (Navigation2) as a versatile navigation framework crucial for ROS-enabled robots, with a specific focus on its application to humanoid robotics. We discussed how Nav2 provides essential tools for path planning, obstacle avoidance, and decision-making through behavior trees. The module highlighted the importance of adapting Nav2 for humanoids' unique bipedal locomotion challenges. Crucially, the chapter emphasized the powerful integration of Nav2 with Isaac ROS, where hardware-accelerated perception feeds high-fidelity environmental data to Nav2, enabling intelligent, precise, and safe navigation for humanoid robots in complex environments.
