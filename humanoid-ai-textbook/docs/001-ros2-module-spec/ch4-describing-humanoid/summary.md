# Chapter 4: Describing Your Humanoid - Summary

This chapter introduced URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) as the essential XML-based file format in ROS 2 for describing a robot's physical and kinematic properties. We explored the core components of a URDF file, specifically **links** (representing rigid bodies with visual, collision, and inertial properties), **joints** (defining connections and movement between links, such as revolute or prismatic types), and **transmissions** (mapping actuators to joints for control). Finally, we discussed the critical role of **Visualizing Your Robot Model** using tools like RViz, which allows for real-time inspection of kinematics, collision detection, sensor data overlay, and debugging of motion planning. URDF provides a standardized blueprint, enabling comprehensive robot design, simulation, and control within the ROS 2 ecosystem.
