# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1, where we explore the foundational concepts of the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) – the "nervous system" that enables communication and coordination within complex robotic systems, especially humanoids. ROS 2 provides a flexible framework for writing robot software, allowing different components (called nodes) to communicate with each other, regardless of their programming language or location.

This module will guide you through:
- **Core Concepts**: Understanding what ROS 2 is, and its fundamental building blocks like nodes.
- **Communication Patterns**: How nodes interact using topics, services, and actions.
- **Connecting to the Robot**: Using `rclpy` to bridge Python agents with ROS controllers.
- **Describing Your Humanoid**: Utilizing URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) to model robot kinematics and visuals.

By the end of this module, you will have a solid grasp of how ROS 2 facilitates the development of intelligent, modular, and robust robotic applications.
