# Introduction to `rclpy`: The Python Client Library

While ROS 2 supports multiple programming languages, Python is often the language of choice for rapid prototyping, AI integration, and high-level control due to its versatility and extensive libraries. `rclpy` is the official Python client library for ROS 2, providing a user-friendly interface to all the core ROS 2 functionalities. It allows Python developers to create ROS 2 nodes, publish and subscribe to topics, offer and request services, and work with actions, all from within the familiar Python environment.

`rclpy` abstracts away much of the underlying complexity of ROS 2's C++ core (`rcl`), enabling developers to focus on the robot's logic rather than intricate communication details. It integrates seamlessly with Python's asyncio for asynchronous operations, which is beneficial for handling multiple concurrent ROS 2 communications without blocking the program. For AI-driven humanoids, `rclpy` is the bridge that connects powerful Python-based AI algorithms and high-level behavioral planners directly into the ROS 2 ecosystem, allowing them to command and receive data from the robot's hardware components.
