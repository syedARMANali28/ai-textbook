**1. What is the official Python client library for ROS 2?**
   a) `rospy`
   b) `rclpy`
   c) `pypcl`
   d) `pyros`

**2. Why is `rclpy` beneficial for integrating AI with ROS 2 robots?**
   a) It only works with C++ AI agents.
   b) It abstracts ROS 2 complexity, allowing Python AI agents to easily command and receive data from robot hardware.
   c) It replaces the need for any AI algorithms.
   d) It is primarily used for visualization, not control.

**3. In a typical setup, what is the role of a Python AI agent using `rclpy`?**
   a) To directly control robot motors at a low level.
   b) To make high-level decisions and send commands to ROS 2 controller nodes.
   c) To develop new ROS 2 communication patterns.
   d) To manage the ROS 2 build system.

**4. What does the "Conceptual Walkthrough: From Python to Robot Motion" primarily demonstrate?**
   a) How to program in C++ for ROS 2.
   b) The detailed hardware schematics of a humanoid robot.
   c) The intelligent interplay between high-level AI decisions and low-level robot control via ROS 2 communication.
   d) The history of Python's development in robotics.
