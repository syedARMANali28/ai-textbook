# Chapter 2: Communication Patterns - Summary

This chapter delved deeper into the fundamental communication patterns within ROS 2. We explored **Topics**, the asynchronous one-to-many publish/subscribe system ideal for continuous data streams like sensor readings. We then covered **Services**, the synchronous one-to-one request/response mechanism used for discrete operations requiring immediate feedback, such as configuration changes. Finally, we introduced **Actions**, designed for long-running, goal-oriented tasks that provide continuous feedback and allow preemption. The chapter concluded with guidance on **Choosing the Right Communication Method**, emphasizing the importance of selecting the appropriate pattern based on data type and interaction requirements for efficient and robust robot application design.
