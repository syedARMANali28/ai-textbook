  Based on the project's `constitution.md` and the overall Spec-Driven Development (SDD) process, we can conceptualize the project development into the following key phases:

  1.  **Project Definition & Planning**
  2.  **Core Feature Development**
  3.  **Integration & Quality Assurance**
  4.  **Deployment & Operational Readiness**
  5.  **Final Validation & Demonstration**
